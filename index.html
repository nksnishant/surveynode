    <h1>Building the Next-Gen CFOs</h1>
    <class="headerText">The organizational landscape is undergoing a massive transformation fueled by digitization and other disruptive technology advancements. The very constructs of workplace, workforce and work itself are being challenged, redefined and reshaped at an unprecedented pace. Finance professionals as well as the overall Finance function have long realized that they cannot afford only a reactive response, and have been expending efforts accordingly to leverage this ambiguity as an opportunity towards making meaningful and long-term adaptations.

    <br><br>The 2019 study by ACCA and SHRM India corroborates this journey ahead for the Finance profession, and how organizations across verticals and regardless of size are weathering these forces of change. It also delineates the key skills and expectations from the next-gen CFOs and senior Finance leaders, along with the roadmap being embraced for future success.
